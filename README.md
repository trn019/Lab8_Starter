Answer to Question: Graceful degradation and service workers are related as service workers will help with integrating features that can work within a browser without internet (after the first initial load), like how Google Docs allows users to edit the docs without internet. It would allow for the developers to hone in what the minimal viable product is without internet being used all the time (has to be used once to load) and if it's possible to have an MVP without having the internet constantly.  If an older browser have difficulty performing with the current internet connection, service workers can help by allowing the browser to run the website.
